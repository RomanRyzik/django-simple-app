Create a basic Django project as follows:

- one single "hello_world" app

- app model based on the following database tables:
--> table_1, with fields:
----> table_1_id (int)
----> field_1 (text)
----> table_2_id (int) (one to many foreign key with table_2)

--> table_2, with fields:
----> table_2_id (int)
----> field_2 (text)

- single view with url "hello-world"
-- pull single entry from table_1 with related entries from table_2, pass to "hello_world.html" template
-- hello_world.html template to render simple text with field_1 as a header and all field_2's as a unordered list

- unit test for the single view
-- unit test needs to use the low level django db connection and a raw sql query
